    <h2> A Bit About Me <img src="icon.png" class="about-image">
    </h2>
    <p>I am a fourth-year student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science with a concentration
    in Human-Centered Computing. I have always been fascinated by how technology shapes society. I chose 
    this concentration because it blends my interests in both people and technology. Growing up in a small 
    town on the North Shore by the water, I developed a love for the outdoors and community, however, I now 
    call Boston home and have enjoyed experiencing the city while being at Northeastern. I've had plenty of opportunities
    while in my time in Boston to refine my skills of the program through projects and the co-op program as well.
    Most of my professional experience is in the financial sector dealing with the software behind investment firms. Those two experiences
were the highlights of my 4 years being that it allowed for hands on experience with financial applications while also allowing for insight 
into the tech industry. In addition to my coursework and professional experience, I love exploring Boston, trying new foods, and spending time with friends. 
I am excited about what the future holds, especially in the field of UI/UX design
After graduation, I hope to continue working in tech, ideally in a role that allows me to bridge the gap technology and society,
 and offer meaningful solutions.</p>
