overview of styling:
I wanted this styling to be pretty consistent across the board. I used similar features and styling throughout 
the connecting pages such as alignment, boxed borders, and a similar color scheme of white, grey, and pink. I thought it was important
to user interaction to include clickable links, photos, and responsive grids/buttons to each page to increase the usability. Fonts, sizing, 
and scale have all been consistent for all associated pages.
